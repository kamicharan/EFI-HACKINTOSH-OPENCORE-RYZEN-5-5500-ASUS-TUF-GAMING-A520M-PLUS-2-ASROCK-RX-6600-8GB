üî¥ UTILIZE APENAS COMO PESQUISA, N√ÉO CARREGUE ESSA EFI EM SEU DISPOSITIVO, CADA CONFIGURA√á√ÉO PRECISA TER SUA PR√ìPRIA EFI CRIADA DO ZERO!

üî¥ USE AS RESEARCH ONLY, DO NOT LOAD THIS EFI ON YOUR DEVICE, EACH CONFIGURATION NEEDS TO HAVE ITS OWN EFI CREATED FROM SCRATCH!

**Latest working macOS**: 14.6.1
<br>
**Current OpenCore**: 1.0.1

## üíª Complete hardware specs
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5500 Sixcore Processor
- MOTHERBOARD: ASUS TUF GAMING A520M-PLUS-2 (BIOS: 3607)
- RAM: 2x 16GB DDR4 3200MHZ
- GPU: ASROCK RX 6600 CLD 8GB GDDR6
- SSD 1#: KINGSTON SNV2S1000G (PCI-Express) - NVME SLOT
- SSD 2# KINGSTON SA400S37480G (PCI) - SATA SLOT
- ETHERNET: Realtek RTL8111 PCI Express Gigabit
- AUDIO: Realtek ALC897


## ‚úÖ What works
- CPU Power Management
- Graphics acceleration (RX 6600 is native for macOS)
- Ethernet (since first install)
- Digital Rights Management (Netflix, Max, Disney+, Apple TV+ etc)
- Audio
- HDMI/DP (two monitors)
- All USB ports
- Everything iCloud related (Drive, iMessage, Facetime, etc)
- Shutdown/Reboot/Update to newer macOS builds over time
- Sleep (It works, but you'll need to click the power button on your PC to wake it up! (mouse or keyboard clicks do not work)

## ‚ùå What doesn't work
- Virtualization (only for Intel)
- Wifi, Bluetooth and Airdrop (because I don't have a wifi card)

## üîê SMBIOS
- SMBIOS iMacPro1,1 (used in this efi)
- Use GenSMBIOS to generate your own unique SMBIOS for your machine
- Every setting should have this and it's different for everyone

## Kexts used:
- AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext
- AppleALC.kext
- AppleMCEReporterDisabler.kext
- Lilu.kext
- NVMeFix.kext (only if you have NVME storage in your build)
- USBMap.kext (Do your own, every desktop needs its own USB mapping!)
- RealtekRTL8111.kext
- RestrictEvents.kext
- SMCAMDProcessor.kext
- VirtualSMC.kext
- WhateverGreen.kext

## SSDTs used:
- Do your own SSDT search, it could be different for every setup!

## üî¥ Information about CPU Cores (IMPORTANT!) üî¥
- In AMD we need to mapp cores for our CPUs or the installation will not even began
- You can learn about this in this repository (but I highly recommend watching Gabriel Luchina's full broadcasts from the Universo Hackintosh channel on youtube!): https://github.com/luchina-gabriel/BASE-EFI-AMD-RYZEN-THREADRIPPER-PUBLIC

## üîê Bios Settings:
‚õî Disable this:
- Serial Port (Advanced Settings>Onboard Devices Configuration>Serial Port Configuration)
- SMV Mode (Advanced Settings>CPU Configuration)
  - Obs: Only if you don't use virtualization in windows (dual-boot)
- Hot Plugs (Advanced Settings> SATA Configuration)
  - Obs: It corrects problems when you use SATA storages in exfat 
- Compatibility Support Module or CSM (Boot>CSM)

‚úÖ Enable this:
- Above 4G Decoding (Advanced Settings>PCI Subsystem Settings)
  - Obs: If when you disabled this, Resize BAR Support pops up, then disable it
- XHCI Hand-off (Advanced Settings>USB Configuration)
- SATA Mode AHCI (Advanced Settings>SATA Configuration)
  - Obs: Sata mode selection as AHCI

‚ùé OBSERVATIONS
- In this motherboard, the secure boot option is not avaliable to enable/disabled, so you have to disable the key SecureBootModel located in your config.plist in: Misc>Security>SecureBootModel=Disabled

- macOS becomes slow when formatting ssd/hd in exFAT
	- In your bios, disable the HOT PLUG function, you can find this option in the sata settings section
