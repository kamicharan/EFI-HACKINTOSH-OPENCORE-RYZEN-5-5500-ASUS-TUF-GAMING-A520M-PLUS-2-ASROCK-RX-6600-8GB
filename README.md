üî¥ UTILIZE APENAS COMO PESQUISA, N√ÉO CARREGUE ESSA EFI EM SEU DISPOSITIVO, CADA CONFIGURA√á√ÉO PRECISA TER SUA PR√ìPRIA EFI CRIADA DO ZERO!

üî¥ USE AS RESEARCH ONLY, DO NOT LOAD THIS EFI ON YOUR DEVICE, EACH CONFIGURATION NEEDS TO HAVE ITS OWN EFI CREATED FROM SCRATCH!

üü¢ THIS REPOSITORY WILL ALWAYS BE UPDATED

**Latest working macOS**: 15.0.0
<br>
**Current OpenCore**: 1.0.1

## üíª Complete hardware specs
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5500 Sixcore Processor
- MOTHERBOARD: ASUS TUF GAMING A520M-PLUS-2 (BIOS: 3607)
- RAM: 2x 16GB DDR4 3200MHZ
- GPU: ASROCK RX 6600 CLD 8GB GDDR6
- SSD 1#: KINGSTON SNV2S1000G (PCI-Express) - NVME SLOT
- SSD 2# KINGSTON SA400S37480G (PCI) - SATA SLOT
- ETHERNET: Realtek RTL8111 PCI Express Gigabit
- AUDIO: Realtek ALC897


## ‚úÖ What works
- CPU Power Management
- Graphics acceleration (RX 6600 is native for macOS)
- Ethernet (since first install)
- Digital Rights Management (Netflix, Max, Disney+, Apple TV+ etc)
- Audio
- HDMI/DP (two monitors)
- All USB ports
- Everything iCloud related (Drive, iMessage, Facetime, etc)
- Shutdown/Reboot/Update to newer macOS builds over time
- Sleep (It works, but you'll need to click the power button on your PC to wake it up! (mouse or keyboard clicks do not work)

## ‚ùå What doesn't work
- Virtualization (only for Intel)
- Wifi, Bluetooth and Airdrop (because I don't have a wifi card)

## üîê SMBIOS
- SMBIOS iMacPro1,1 (used in this efi)
- Use GenSMBIOS to generate your own unique SMBIOS for your machine
- Every setting should have this and it's different for everyone

## Kexts used:
- AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext
- AppleALC.kext
- AppleMCEReporterDisabler.kext
- Lilu.kext
- NVMeFix.kext (only if you have NVME storage in your build)
- USBMap.kext (Do your own, every desktop needs its own USB mapping!)
- RealtekRTL8111.kext
- RestrictEvents.kext
- SMCAMDProcessor.kext
- VirtualSMC.kext
- WhateverGreen.kext

## SSDTs used:
- Do your own SSDT search, it could be different for every setup!

## üî¥ Information about CPU Cores (IMPORTANT!) üî¥
- In AMD we need to mapp cores for our CPUs or the installation will not even began
- You can learn about this in this repository (but I highly recommend watching Gabriel Luchina's full broadcasts from the Universo Hackintosh channel on youtube!): https://github.com/luchina-gabriel/BASE-EFI-AMD-RYZEN-THREADRIPPER-PUBLIC

## üîê Bios Settings:
‚õî Disable this:
- Serial Port (Advanced Settings>Onboard Devices Configuration>Serial Port Configuration)
- SMV Mode (Advanced Settings>CPU Configuration)
  - Obs: Only if you don't use virtualization in windows (dual-boot)
- Hot Plugs (Advanced Settings> SATA Configuration)
  - Obs: It corrects problems when you use SATA storages in exfat 
- Compatibility Support Module or CSM (Boot>CSM)

‚úÖ Enable this:
- Above 4G Decoding (Advanced Settings>PCI Subsystem Settings)
  - Obs: If when you disabled this, Resize BAR Support pops up, then disable it
- XHCI Hand-off (Advanced Settings>USB Configuration)
- SATA Mode AHCI (Advanced Settings>SATA Configuration)
  - Obs: Sata mode selection as AHCI

## Extras (It's not just especially for this setup):
- Discord crashes or mic failure:
	- See this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odYcvq-iTGg&lc=Ugwmaet9MEjL90f9ZAx4AaABAg.A75qVL2svqnA7756I1FDYq)

- macOS becomes slow when formatting ssd/hd in exFAT
	- In your bios, disable the HOT PLUG function, you can find this option in the sata settings section

- Your GPU is around 48¬∞C - 54¬∞C in IDLE and the fans only turn on when the gpu hits 65¬∞C or higher! You can fix that using the DeviceProperties in config.plist, check this tutorial:

- You use the adobe products like Photoshop, Premiere Pro? In the AMD processors, this apps usually don't work properly, so you need to follow some steps that you can find in the tutorial below:
